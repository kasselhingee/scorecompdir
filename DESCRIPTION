Description: Score matching is a useful estimation technique when the normalising constant for a probability distribution is difficult to compute. The package includes methods by Scealy and Wood [refs] for compositional data and the Polynomially-Tilted Pairwise Interaction (PPI), which perform well when there are zeros (even many zeros). The package also includes hybrid estimators for directional distributions proposed by Mardia et al [ref].
