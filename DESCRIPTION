Description: Score matching is a useful estimation technique when the normalising constant for a probability distribution is difficult to compute.  This package implements score matching estimators using automatic differentiation in the CppAD library <https://github.com/coin-or/CppAD> and is designed for quickly implementing more estimators. General Windham robustification <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2346159> is also available. Already in the package are estimators for directional distributions (Mardia, Kent and Laha (2016) <arXiv:1604.08470>) and the flexible Polynomially-Tilted Pairwise Interaction (PPI) model for compositional data.  The latter estimators perform well when there are zeros, even many zeros (Scealy and Wood, 2022 <doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.2016422>; Scealy, Hingee, Kent, and Wood, 2024, accepted article).
