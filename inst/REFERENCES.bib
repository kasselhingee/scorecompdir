  abstract = {One often wants to estimate statistical models where the probability density function is known only up to a multiplicative normalization constant. Typically, one then has to resort to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, or approximations of the normalization constant. Here, we propose that such models can be estimated by minimizing the expected squared distance between the gradient of the log-density given by the model and the gradient of the log-density of the observed data.  While the estimation of the gradient of log-density function is, in principle, a very difficult non-parametric problem, we prove a surprising result that gives a simple formula for this objective function. The density function of the observed data does not appear in this formula, which simplifies to a sample average of a sum of some derivatives of the log-density given by the model.  The validity of the method is demonstrated on multivariate Gaussian and independent component analysis models, and by estimating an overcomplete filter set for natural image data.},

  abstract = {One of the major problems for maximum likelihood estimation in the well-established directional models is that the normalising constants can be difficult to evaluate. A new general method of "score matching estimation" is presented here on a compact oriented Riemannian manifold. Important applications include von Mises-Fisher, Bingham and joint models on the sphere and related spaces. The estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed under mild regularity conditions. Further, it is easy to compute as a solution of a linear set of equations and requires no knowledge of the normalizing constant. Several examples are given, both analytic and numerical, to demonstrate its good performance.},

  abstract = {Compositional data are challenging to analyse due to the non-negativity and sum-to-one constraints on the sample space. With real data it is often the case that many of the compositional components are highly right-skewed, with large numbers of zeros. Major limitations of currently available models for compositional data include one or more of the following: insufficient flexibility in terms of distributional shape; difficulty in accommodating zeros in the data in estimation; and lack of computational viability in moderate to high dimensions. In this article we propose a new model, the polynomially-tilted pairwise interaction (PPI) model, for analysing compositional data. Maximum likelihood estimation is difficult for the PPI model. Instead, we propose novel score matching estimators, which entails extending the score matching approach to Riemannian manifolds with boundary. These new estimators are available in closed form and simulation studies show that they perform well in practice. As our main application we analyse real microbiome count data with fixed totals using a multinomial latent variable model with a PPI model for the latent variable distribution. We prove that, under certain conditions, the new score matching estimators are consistent for the parameters in the new multinomial latent variable model.},

  abstract = {A robust method for fitting a model from a parametric family is fundamental to effective statistical analysis. A procedure is given for robustifying any model fitting process by using weights from the family from which the model is to be chosen. The weighting reduces the influence of information that is not compatible with the model family, while maintaining the basic structure of a familiar model fitting process. The procedure produces a parametric family of model fitting functions. The value of the parameter determines the degree to which the weighting influences the robustified model fit. A mechanism for determining an appropriate value for the parameter is described.},
