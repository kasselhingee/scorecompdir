\title{Iterative Score Matching Estimator Using Conjugate-Gradient Descent}
\usage{
cppad_search(
  smotape,
  theta,
  Y,
  Yapproxcentres = NA * Y,
  w = rep(1, nrow(Y)),
  approxorder = 10,
  control = default_Rcgmin()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{smotape}{A tape of a score matching objective function.
The \code{smotape}'s independent variables are assumed to be the model parameters to fit
and the \code{smotape}'s dynamic parameter is a (multivariate) measurement.}

\item{theta}{The starting parameter set}

\item{Y}{A matrix of multivariate observations. Each row is an observation.}

\item{Yapproxcentres}{A matrix of Taylor approximation centres for rows of Y that require approximation. \code{NA} for rows that do not require approximation.}

\item{w}{Weights for each observation.}

\item{approxorder}{The order of Taylor approximation to use.}

\item{control}{Control parameters passed to \code{\link[Rcgmin:Rcgmin]{Rcgmin::Rcgmin()}}}
}
\description{
Uses conjugate gradient descent to search for a vector of parameters such that gradient of the score matching objective is within tolerance of zero.
Also estimates standard errors and covariance.
Useful when the score matching objective function is not of quadratic form;
for score matching objective functions that are quadratic \code{\link[=cppad_closed]{cppad_closed()}} will be usually be more accurate and faster.
}
\details{
The score matching objective function and gradient of the score matching function are passed to \code{\link[Rcgmin:Rcgmin]{Rcgmin::Rcgmin()}}.
Taylor approximations are performed using \code{\link[=pTaylorApprox]{pTaylorApprox()}} for measurements with non-\code{NA} rows in \code{Yapproxcentres}.
The call to \code{\link[Rcgmin:Rcgmin]{Rcgmin::Rcgmin()}} uses the \emph{sum} of observations (as opposed to the mean) to reduce floating point inaccuracies. This has implications for the meaning of the control parameters passed to \code{Rcgmin()} (e.g. \code{tol}). The results are converted into averages so the use of sums can be ignored when not setting control parameters, or studying the behaviour of Rcgmin.

Standard errors are only computed when the weights are constant, and use the Godambe information matrix (aka sandwich method) (\emph{would like a good reference for this here}).
The sensitivity matrix \eqn{G} is estimated as
the negative of the average over the Hessian of \code{smotape} evaluated at each observation in \code{Y}.
The variability matrix \eqn{J} is then estimated as
the sample covariance (denominator of \eqn{n-1}) of the gradiant of \code{smotape} evaluated at each of the observations in \code{Y} for the estimated \eqn{\theta}.
The variance of the estimator is then estimated as
\eqn{G^{-1}JG^{-1}/n,}
where \code{n} is the number of observations.
